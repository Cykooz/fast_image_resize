## [4.2.1] - 2024-07-24

### Fixed

- Disabled default features of the `image` crate (#36).

## [4.2.0] - 2024-07-19

### Added

- Added new resize algorithm `ResizeAlg::Interpolation` (#32).

  It is like `ResizeAlg::Convolution` but with fixed kernel size.
  This algorithm can be useful if you want to get a result similar
  to `OpenCV` (except `INTER_AREA` interpolation).

## [4.1.0] - 2024-07-14

### Added

- Added support for optimization with help of `SSE4.1` and `AVX2` for
  the `F32` pixel type.
- Added support for new pixel types `F32x2`, `F32x3` and `F32x4` with
  optimizations for `SSE4.1` and `AVX2` (#30).

## [4.0.0] - 2024-05-13

### Added

- Added Gaussian filter for convolution algorithm.
- Method `PixelType::size()` was made public.
- Added new image containers:
    - `ImageRef`
    - `TypedImageRef`
    - `TypedImage`
    - `TypedCroppedImage`
    - `TypedCroppedImageMut`
    - `CroppedImage`
    - `CroppedImageMut`

### Fixed

- Fixed dividing image by alpha channel.

### Changed

A lot of **breaking changes** have been done in this release:

- Structures `ImageView` and `ImageViewMut` have been removed. They always
  did unnecessary memory allocation to store references to image rows.
  Instead of these structures, the `ImageView` and `ImageViewMut` traits
  have been added. The crate accepts any image container that provides
  these traits.
- Also, traits `IntoImageView` and `IntoImageViewMut` have been added.
  They allow you to write runtime adapters to convert your particular
  image container into something that provides `ImageView`/`ImageViewMut` trait.
- `Resizer` now has two methods for resize (dynamic and typed):
    - `resize()` accepts references to `impl IntoImageView` and `impl IntoImageViewMut`;
    - `resize_typed()` accepts references to `impl ImageView` and `impl ImageViewMut`.
- Resize methods also accept the `options` argument.
  With the help of this argument, you can specify:
    - resize algorithm (default: Lanczos3);
    - how to crop the source image;
    - whether to multiply the source image by the alpha channel and
      divide the destination image by the alpha channel.
      By default, Resizer multiplies and divides by alpha channel
      images with `U8x2`, `U8x4`, `U16x2` and `U16x4` pixels.
- Argument `resize_alg` was removed from `Resizer::new()` method, use
  `options` argument of methods to resize instead.
- The `MulDiv` implementation has been changed in the same way as `Resizer`.
  It now has two versions of each method: dynamic and typed.
- Type of image dimensions has been changed from `NonZeroU32` into `u32`.
  Now you can create and use zero-sized images.
- `Image` (embedded implementation of image container) moved from root of
  the crate into module `images`.
- Added optional feature "image".
  It adds implementation of traits `IntoImageView` and `IntoImageViewMut` for the
  [DynamicImage](https://docs.rs/image/latest/image/enum.DynamicImage.html) type
  from the `image` crate. This implementation allows you to use `DynamicImage`
  instances as arguments for methods of this crate.

Look at the difference between versions 3 and 4 on example
of resizing RGBA8 image from given u8-buffer with pixels-data.

3.x version:

```rust
use fast_image_resize::{Image, MulDiv, PixelType, Resizer};
use std::num::NonZeroU32;

fn my_resize(
    src_width: u32,
    src_height: u32,
    src_pixels: &mut [u8],
    dst_width: u32,
    dst_height: u32,
) -> Image {
    let src_width = NonZeroU32::new(src_width).unwrap();
    let src_height = NonZeroU32::new(src_height).unwrap();
    let src_image = Image::from_slice_u8(
        src_width,
        src_height,
        src_pixels,
        PixelType::U8x4,
    ).unwrap();

    // Multiple RGB channels of source image by alpha channel.
    let alpha_mul_div = MulDiv::default();
    let mut tmp_image = Image::new(
        src_width,
        src_height,
        PixelType::U8x4,
    );
    alpha_mul_div
        .multiply_alpha(
            &src_image.view(),
            &mut tmp_image.view_mut(),
        ).unwrap();

    // Create container for data of destination image.
    let dst_width = NonZeroU32::new(dst_width).unwrap();
    let dst_height = NonZeroU32::new(dst_height).unwrap();
    let mut dst_image = Image::new(
        dst_width,
        dst_height,
        PixelType::U8x4,
    );

    // Get mutable view of destination image data.
    let mut dst_view = dst_image.view_mut();

    // Create Resizer instance and resize source image
    // into buffer of destination image.
    let mut resizer = Resizer::default();
    resizer.resize(&tmp_image.view(), &mut dst_view).unwrap();

    // Divide RGB channels of destination image by alpha.
    alpha_mul_div.divide_alpha_inplace(&mut dst_view).unwrap();

    dst_image
}
```

4.x version:

```rust
use fast_image_resize::images::{Image, ImageRef};
use fast_image_resize::{PixelType, Resizer};

fn my_resize(
    src_width: u32,
    src_height: u32,
    src_pixels: &[u8],
    dst_width: u32,
    dst_height: u32,
) -> Image {
    let src_image = ImageRef::new(
        src_width,
        src_height,
        src_pixels,
        PixelType::U8x4,
    ).unwrap();

    // Create container for data of destination image.
    let mut dst_image = Image::new(
        dst_width,
        dst_height,
        PixelType::U8x4,
    );

    // Create Resizer instance and resize source image
    // into buffer of destination image.
    let mut resizer = Resizer::new();
    // By default, Resizer multiplies and divides by alpha channel
    // images with U8x2, U8x4, U16x2 and U16x4 pixels.
    resizer.resize(&src_image, &mut dst_image, None).unwrap();

    dst_image
}
